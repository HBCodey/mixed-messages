This is my first portfolio project as part of Codecademys full stack engineering path.

I created a random quote generator using characters and quotes from some of my favourite films and tv series.
I used JavaScript, HTML and a bit of CSS.

I will return later to polish the project off and make it look nicer, but functionally the project is complete.
