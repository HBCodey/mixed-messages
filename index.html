    <h1>Movie Quote Generator</h1>
    <p id="quote"> <i> The movie quote will go here</i></p>
    <p id="character"> <b> The character saying the quote will go here</b></p>
    <p id="movie"> The movie from which the quote comes will go here</p>
    <br>
    <p> Oh just had an idea, perhaps I can make a photo of the character saying the quote appear, and the quote can look like a speech bubble?</p>
